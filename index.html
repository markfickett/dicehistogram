<h2>How Fair Is My D20?</h2>

<p>An automatic system for rolling a polyhedral die and taking photos of the rolls; extracting the image of just the die from those images; clustering the images of the die by which face is shown; and analyzing the results.<p>

<p>I was inspired in part by the <a href="http://www.awesomedice.com/blog/353/d20-dice-randomness-test-chessex-vs-gamescience/">Awesome Dice Blog's 2012 post</a> comparing d20 fairness between two manufacturers. (<a href="http://blog.codeoptimism.com/most-d20-dice-are-notably-imbalanced/">Christopher Galpin in 2014</a> links to a number of other interesting analyses; <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v14n3/datasets.kern.html">John Kern in 2006</a> does Bayesian analysis for Pass the Pigs.) They rolled and tallied by hand.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<img src="arduino/151123dicehistogramsummary.png" alt="summary of all dice, with standard deviation and expected value" />

<p>Smaller standard deviation is better, and expected values closer to 10&frac12; are better (meaning "fairer" in both cases).</p>

<p>Expected value is the average roll; for an ideal, fair d20 this is 10&frac12;, so the graph shows most of the tested d20s are slightly unlucky. However this graph doesn't tell you about specific roll outcomes (like 20s or 1s).</p>

<p>The standard deviation is on the normalized frequencies of the rolls for a die; thus a d20 where all sides have ideal (1.0) frequency has a standard deviation of 0.0, whereas dice with more variation have higher standard deviations.</p>

<p>Full outcome data for all dice is available in the git repository, and the source data for these charts is <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B74DWbIuYkDKVDJjLVpxZXlhUG8">shared on Google Drive</a>.</p>

<p>Trends within brands are discussed below, but it appears that across brands d20s are less fair then dice with fewer sides.</p>

<h3>How Many Rolls?</h3>

<p>About 100 rolls per die face.</p>

<p>The below data is from an opaque purple Wiz Dice d20, rolled 8000 times.</p>

<img src="arduino/151031d20wizdiceopaquepurplesubsamples.png" alt="histogram showing frequency of each side after different numbers of rolls" />

<p>The different datasets are from random subsamples of the actual rolled sequence. So the blue series labeled "100" is from taking 100 random rolls from the set of 8000, and charting the relative frequency of each side within that subsample; similarly for the other sample counts.</p>

<p>The relative side frequencies for 1000 rolls or (especially) 100 rolls are fairly different from the frequencies at 8000 rolls. But anything from 2000 up looks fairly close. Thus I conclude that 3000 rolls should give a reasonable picture of the die's behavior (and actually 2000 is probably sufficient).</p>

<p>For a Crystal Caste clear black d8, rolled 3000 times:</p>

<img src="arduino/151111d8crystalcasteclearblacksubsamples.png" alt="histogram of subsamples for a d8" />

<p>In this case, frequencies with 512 samples look somewhat different from those at 3000, but with 1024 it's fairly close.</p>

<p>This leads me to a heuristic of 100 rolls per side (800 for a d8, 2000 for a d20). It is of course a subjective heuristic.</p>

<h2>Hardware Setup (Die Roller and Camera)</h2>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdA5ydENTHY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>A microcontroller runs a servo motor to shake a small tub, and triggers a camera to take pictures. More details: <a href="TODO">Arduino sketch and hardware parts list</a>.

<h3>Construction</h3>

<p>The main container is an empty (and well washed) ice cream carton, chosen for its flat bottom and sloping sides. The servo motor's arm is taped to the side, and a paperclip makes the pivot on the opposite side. A simple U of cardboard forms the stand (with weights on it to keep it still). The servo motor is mounted in a snugly fitting hole cut in the cardboard.</p>

<p>The LEDs are placed through slots in the carton, facing downward. This keeps them from shining back up at the camera. One power supply wire is inside the carton, and one outside (soldered in place). A small piece of translucent plastic (from a nametag holder) makes a ramp so the die can roll over the LEDs/wire.</p>

<p>Plastic wrap with a rubber-band provides a cover. This prevents the die from rolling out when the carton tips down for each roll. With the LEDs on and the room lights off, there is negligable glare.</p>

<p>The camera is a Nikon D90, using a long (55-200mm) lens for low perspective distortion across the visual field. It is triggered via wired remote (though the GPS/remote port was defective and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markfickett/albums/72157660801468561">required repair</a>); and powered via its AC adapter port (using <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1107374">a 3D-printed plug</a>).</p>

</h3>Performance</h3>

<ul>
<li>Timing: In several thousand rolls, only a few do not fully settle before the photograph is taken. With this timing, it captures about 790 rolls per hour (or one every 4&frac12; seconds).</li>
<li>Repeatability: Despite quick construction, the servo and its taped attachment reliably returns the tub to the same position, closely enough for analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Noise. The servo motor's whine carries, as does the sound of the die hitting the inside of the paper tub. Heavier or less resonant materials might help, as could lining the container with something like felt.</li>
<li>Turbulence. The smaller dice (d4 and d6) slide down the tub's side when it tilts down, rather than rolling; this can lead to repeatedly rolling the same number. Bumpy sides on the container, or tilting further down, might help.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software Explanation</h2>

There are two computer-vision tasks in this process: finding the die within the larger photo of the die-rolling area; and figuring out which picture is of which face of the die.

<h3>Cropping</h3>

<p>A photo of the rolled die is diffed against a reference image.</p>

<img src="arduino/151102dicehistogramreference.jpg" />
<img src="arduino/151102dicehistogramdie.jpg" />

<p>The result is scanned for areas of high difference to find the die. The die is flood-filled to find its area; the then image of the die is cropped out and saved.</p>

<img src="arduino/151102dicehistogramdiffwithscan.jpg" />

<p>The above image was obtained from running `crop.py` with `--debug`. The base (mostly black) image is the diff of the image with the die and the reference image. The blue lines are where the image was scanned, the red highlighted line segments are where a large difference was detected. The green dotted box was the detected bounds of the die.</p>

<p>Scanning is done on a scaled down version of the images, but the cropped image of the die is saved at full resolution for better feature detection.</p>

<h3>Clustering</h3>

<p>Images of the die are compared using features, detected and matched using OpenCV.</p>

<img src="arduino/151102dicehistogramfeaturematchgood.jpg" />

<p>These screenshots from the <code>find_obj.py</code> OpenCV demo show good (above) and bad (below) matches. The white rectangles on the right side are the homography: the area of the right image that matches up with the left image. Good matches not only have a high number of matching points, but a simple (translation and rotation only) homography with low distortion.</p>

<img src="arduino/151102dicehistogramfeaturematchbad.jpg" />
<img src="arduino/151102dicehistogramfeaturematchskew.jpg" />

<p>The first step builds a list of dissimilar representative images, against which all other images get compared. Each representative gets a list of matching members (the images showing the same face of the die).</p>

<p>This tends to result in big groups for each of the sides of the die, and a bunch of small groups (1-10 each) of images that didn't match any of the representatives well. So a second step takes the small groups and compares them to members of the larger groups (not just their representative images) to find a match.</p>
